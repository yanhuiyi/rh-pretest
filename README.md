  1. When I worked for RealNetworks. I worked with desinger closely, and give an advice for designer to design a more dynamic look and feel for real.com; Worked with designers by providing prototypes. Finally the proposal was taken. The new website gained more page view. Another one is when I worked in TheKnot, where there are several talent designers, I participated in desing review flow and gave feedback to designers and tweaked the page in a quick way. I proposed to develop a HTML Email generator tools to free the developers repetitive work, which is taken by managers and saved a great deal of effor for the team.
